## Features

This project emits TypeScript types from Java sources.
`jtsgen` is implemented as an annotation processor, therefore it should be
easily integrated in your current build infrastructure. So here are the
prominent features:

* Emitting types and documentation from annotated Java classes and interfaces at *compile* time
* Several  module types and output variants supported
* read only and name space support
* configured at source the code location (package annotation)

## Documentation

The documentation, including an introduction and a complete list of all features, is available on:

> --> [http://jtsgen.readthedocs.io](http://jtsgen.readthedocs.io) <--


So here is a small demo:

As you can see, if the IDE is configured correctly, the java sources are
converted immediately.
