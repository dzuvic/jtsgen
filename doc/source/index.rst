jtsgen: Java -> TypeScript Emitter
##################################

The project *tsgen* (former *jtsgen*) emits TypeScript ambient types
from Java sources. *tsgen* is implemented as an annotation processor,
therefore it should be easily integrated in your current build infrastructure.
Usually there are no other plugins required for your build system
(maven, gradle).
